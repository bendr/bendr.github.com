          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This document describes the main concepts behind the Bender runtime.
            There can be different types of runtimes for Bender, such as
            <em>DOM-based</em> runtimes, <em>static</em> runtimes or
            <em>procedural</em> runtimes.
            This specification covers only the first case in detail, as it is
            implemented by the reference runtime.
            Later versions may cover other types of runtimes in more detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>DOM-based</strong> runtime is a runtime that uses the DOM
            tree of a document, called the <strong>host document</strong>, as
            the target of its output.
            Rendering is done by adding DOM nodes (elements, attributes, and
            text nodes) in the host tree.
            The host tree itself is rendered by a <strong>host
              application</strong>, most likely a Web browser.
            The reference runtime follows this model.
            It is run inside a browser, using a HTML5 host document and
            Javascript to render components.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bender reference implementation also allows authors to write
            custom runtimes.
            It is possible for instance to duplicate the functionality of the
            reference runtime but with an SVG host document as opposed to an
            HTML5 host document.
            It is also possible to insert one or more Bender components into a
            document at arbitrary locations using scripting and the Bender
            Javascript library.
            See the Javascript API of the Bender context for the documentation
            of these functionalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>static</strong> runtime is not really a runtime, but more
            of a translator, or compiler (whereas a DOM-based or procedural
            runtime is more similar to an interpreter.)
            In a static runtime, the Bender application is rendered into a
            static output, which in the context of Bender means that the
            result output has lost its ability to refer to its original
            definition (just like a compiler usually discards the source of the
            program to produce its output.)
            It is possible to go further and imagine two kinds of static
            runtimes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              the <em>compiler</em>, which translates a Bender description into
              a form that can be run directly.
              For instance, a Bender compiler would produce a HTML5 document
              with Javascript code that looks just like a regular Web
              application and can run directly into a regular browser without
              requiring any additional support;
            </li>
            <li>
              the <em>printer</em>, which outputs a static document, such as an
              image or a PDF file, of the current state of the application.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Lastly, a <strong>procedural</strong> runtime is a runtime that
            renders a Bender document in a procedural, rather than declarative,
            fashion.
            While a DOM-based runtime is lazy and simply outputs DOM nodes,
            leaving the host application in charge managing the resul, a
            procedural runtime takes full control and actively manages all
            aspects of the output.
            An hypothetic procedural render could render Bender applications in
            a HTML5 <code>canvas</code> element, using a 2D context, or WebGL
            for a 3D rendering.

          <h2>The Bender context</h2>
          <p>
            The Bender <strong>context</strong> is the entity in charge
            of managing the execution environment of Bender components.
            It provides basic functionality for component loading and rendering,
            as well as convenience methods to support the runtime and Bender
            applications.
            It also runs the different runtime update sequences as described
            below.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Rendering a Bender component in a host document</h2>
          <p>
            In a DOM-based runtime, a component is rendered by creating a
            document fragment, and inserting it in the tree of the host
            document.
            The <strong>target</strong> of a component is the insertion point
            for such a fragment.
            It is defined by a <em>parent element</em> and an optional
            <em>reference node</em>, which must be a child of the parent
            element if present.
            The document fragment is inserted as a child of the parent element,
            before the reference node if it is defined, or as the last child
            otherwise.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Runtime update sequences</h2>
          <section>
            <p>
              The DOM-based runtime operates by first creating one or more
              contexts as described above.
              Once a context becomes available, <em>requests</em> can be made
              to perform operations in that context.
              The runtime maintains a queue of requests so that they can be
              prioritized (<em>e.g.</em>, as much of a component should be
              constructed before it is rendered.)
              This request mechanism is transparent to the author: no explicit
              “request” needs to be made to the runtime, but simple calls to the
              API, such as creating an element, setting a property, &amp;c.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is however useful to describe the handling of requests to
              better define the semantics of Bender.
              A batch of requests is processed in an <em>update sequence</em>.
              While an update sequence is being executed, all new requests are
              queued and will be processed in the next sequence (with the
              exception of the internal update sequence as describe below.)
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Initialize a request queue <em>Q</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a request is made, add it to <em>Q</em> and set a timer
                <em>T</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additional requests made before <em>T</em> expires are added to
                <em>Q</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                When <em>T</em> expires, initialize a new request queue
                <em>Q'</em>.
                Unless otherwise noted, new requests are now added to
                <em>Q’</em>, setting a timer <em>T’</em>, which will not expire
                before all requests from <em>Q</em> have been processed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Process requests from <em>Q</em>.
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                  <li>
                    Process all <em>explicit update</em> requests,
                    <em>i.e.</em>, requests made explicitely through the
                    Javascript API (see the explicit updates sequence below.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Process all <em>rendering update</em> requests,
                    <em>i.e.</em>, render components that have been created or
                    added in the previous step (see the rendering sequence
                    below.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Process all <em>implicit update</em> requests,
                    <em>i.e.</em>, requests resulting from changes made in the
                    previous steps and from component watches (see the implicit
                    updates sequence below.)
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                All requests from <em>Q</em> have been processed, so <em>Q</em>
                is replaced with <em>Q’</em>.
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                  <li>
                    If <em>T’</em> was not set, go back to step 2.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If <em>T’</em> was set (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>Q’</em> is not
                    empty), replace the expired <em>T</em> with <em>T’</em>,
                    which may now expire.
                    Go back to step 3.
                  </li>
                </ol>

            </ol>

            <h3>The explicit updates sequence</h3>
            <p>
              An <strong>explicit update</strong> is a made through the
              Javascript API.
              For instance, creating components programmatically and adding them
              to a context generate explicit update requests.
              Setting a property on a component through Javascript is another
              example of explicit update request.
            </p>
            <p>
              An explicit update will most likely create new update requests as
              a side-effect.
              These requests are added to the queue <em>Q</em> so that they are
              processed in the same batch of update sequences.
              Adding a new component will create a rendering update, so that the
              component is rendered as soon as possible.
              Modifying the DOM tree or setting a property of a rendered
              component will generate implicit update requests.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>The rendering updates sequence</h3>
            <p>
              Components that have not been rendered yet are now rendered,
              using the current DOM content for the component as set through
              the previously processed explicit updates.
              This generates a <code>@rendered</code> event which may cause
              implicit updates.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>The implicit update sequence</h3>
            <p>
              An <strong>implicit update</strong> is an update that needs to be
              made in order to maintain the consistency of the running
              application.
              As the name implies, these updates are not made explicitely by the
              author, but by the runtime itself as a side-effect of a previous
              update, or as result of a watch being activated.
            </p>
            <p>
              An implicit update may modify the rendering of a component.
              This differs from a rendering update in that an
              <code>@update</code> event is generated rather than a
              <code>@rendered</code> event.
