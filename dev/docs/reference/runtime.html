          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This document describes the main concepts behind the Bender runtime.
            There can be different types of runtimes for Bender, such as
            <em>DOM-based</em> runtimes, <em>static</em> runtimes or
            <em>procedural</em> runtimes.
            This specification covers only the first case in detail, as it is
            implemented by the reference runtime.
            Later versions may cover other types of runtimes in more detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>DOM-based</strong> runtime is a runtime that uses the DOM
            tree of a document, called the <strong>host document</strong>, as
            the target of its output.
            Rendering is done by adding DOM nodes (elements, attributes, and
            text nodes) in the host tree.
            The host tree itself is rendered by a <strong>host
              application</strong>, most likely a Web browser.
            The reference runtime follows this model.
            It is run inside a browser, using a HTML5 host document and
            Javascript to render components.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bender reference implementation also allows authors to write
            custom runtimes.
            It is possible for instance to duplicate the functionality of the
            reference runtime but with an SVG host document as opposed to an
            HTML5 host document.
            It is also possible to insert one or more Bender components into a
            document at arbitrary locations using scripting and the Bender
            Javascript library.
            See the Javascript API of the Bender context for the documentation
            of these functionalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>static</strong> runtime is not really a runtime, but more
            of a translator, or compiler (whereas a DOM-based or procedural
            runtime is more similar to an interpreter.)
            In a static runtime, the Bender application is rendered into a
            static output, which in the context of Bender means that the
            result output has lost its ability to refer to its original
            definition (just like a compiler usually discards the source of the
            program to produce its output.)
            It is possible to go further and imagine two kinds of static
            runtimes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              the <em>compiler</em>, which translates a Bender description into
              a form that can be run directly.
              For instance, a Bender compiler would produce a HTML5 document
              with Javascript code that looks just like a regular Web
              application and can run directly into a regular browser without
              requiring any additional support;
            </li>
            <li>
              the <em>printer</em>, which outputs a static document, such as an
              image or a PDF file, of the current state of the application.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Lastly, a <strong>procedural</strong> runtime is a runtime that
            renders a Bender document in a procedural, rather than declarative,
            fashion.
            While a DOM-based runtime is lazy and simply outputs DOM nodes,
            leaving the host application in charge managing the resul, a
            procedural runtime takes full control and actively manages all
            aspects of the output.
            An hypothetic procedural render could render Bender applications in
            a HTML5 <code>canvas</code> element, using a 2D context, or WebGL
            for a 3D rendering.

          <h2>The Bender context</h2>
          <p>
            The Bender <strong>context</strong> is the entity in charge
            of managing the execution environment of Bender components.
            It provides basic functionality for component loading and rendering,
            as well as convenience methods to support the runtime and Bender
            applications.
            It also runs the different runtime cycles as described below.

          <h2>Rendering a Bender component in host document</h2>
          <p>
            In a DOM-based runtime, a component is rendered by creating a
            document fragment, and inserting it in the tree of the host
            document.
            The <strong>target</strong> of a component is the insertion point
            for a fragment
          </p>

          <h2>Runtime cycles</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>The rendering cycle</h3>
            <p>
              The rendering cycle is the execution of the rendering process
              for components that have been added to the Bender tree but have
              not been rendered yet.
